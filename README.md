# Sales-Forcasting

## OBJECTIVE
The objective of this project is to develop an accurate predictive model capable of forecasting quarterly sales for each of the 75 customers of a steel manufacturing company. In addition to leveraging company-specific data, the model will utilize general economic indicators.

## PROJECT BACKGROUND
In this project, our primary objective is to forecast sales for the upcoming two quarters, namely Q8 and Q9, leveraging historical sales data spanning a timeframe of two years and three months. Our dataset encompasses sales records for a total of 75 customers, offering a comprehensive understanding of sales dynamics across diverse sectors.

## INTRODUCTION

Accurate sales forecasting is essential for effective decision-making and strategic planning in business operations. For B2B companies like steel manufacturers, predicting quarterly sales for different customers is crucial. This project endeavors to forecast quarterly sales for each of the 75 customers through innovative methodologies. The objective is to develop predictive models proficient in accurately estimating sales figures over quarterly periods. Utilizing the dataset provided by a Kaggle competition, a thorough analysis was conducted. Multiple machine learning techniques, including Linear Regression, RandomForest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Bayesian Ridge Regression, Ridge Regression, XGBoostRegression, Gradientboost Regressor, MLPRegressor, CatBoost, and Neural Networks, were employed. Through extensive exploration of algorithms and features, the aim was to strike a balance between model stability and performance, crucial for real-world applicability
